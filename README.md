# Simple Django notes app
This is my sample project, done on the Django framework.

This is the simple notes app. It allows user to register in the app and then login to store user's notes. The app has two pages - "Add notes" allows to add new note to the users notes. "Notes" page allows to see all authorized user's notes and also remove any of them if necessary.
